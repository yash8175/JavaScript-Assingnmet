function outerfunction(){
    var outervariable=100;
    function innerfunction(){
        alert(outervariable);
    }
    return innerfunction;
}
var innerfunc=outerfunction();
innerfunc();


1)Is the innerfunction() a closure?
 Yes, the innerfunnction() is a closure.
 output:100


2)What is a difference between a closure and a scope?
  When we create a function within another function,then the innerfunction is closure. This closure is usually returned
  so that we can use the outerfunction variable at a later time and scope determines the accessibility of variables.
 
3)What is lexical scope and how is it related to closure?
 Basically lexical scope is any innerfunction can have access to  its outerscope variables and a closure is a function that
 captures variables from its lexical scope.

4)Output of following closure?
  
for( var i=0; i<3; i++){
setTimeout(function log(){
console.log(i);
},1000);
}

ouput:3
